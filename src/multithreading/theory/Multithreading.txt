What is Multithreading?
Multithreading means that you have multiple threads of execution inside the same application. A thread is like a separate CPU executing your application.
Thus, a multithreaded application is like an application that has multiple CPUs executing different parts of the code at the same time.

Multitasking
Later came multitasking which meant that computers could execute multiple programs (AKA tasks or processes) at the same time.
It wasn't really "at the same time" though.
 The single CPU was shared between the programs.
 The operating system would switch between the programs running, executing each of them for a little while before switching.

Along with multitasking came new challenges for software developers. Programs can no longer assume to have all the CPU time available, nor all memory or any other computer resources. A "good citizen" program should release all resources it is no longer using, so other programs can use them
